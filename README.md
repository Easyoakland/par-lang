## Setting up

If you don't have Rust and Cargo installed, [do that first](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Then clone this repository and execute

```
$ cargo run
```

to open the interactive playground.

# The Par language guide

Par (â…‹) is an experimental concurrent programming language. It's an attempt to bring the expressive power
of linear logic into practice.

Since this is a programming language guide and not a math textbook, we won't be mentioning logic from now on,
until the very last section. **It's not important to know anything about logic to understand the language.**
The value of basing the language on linear logic is that it provides a powerful design guidance.

First off, let's list some **general properties of Par:**

- Code executes in **isolated processes.**
- Processes **communicate** with each other **via channels.**
- Every channel has **two end-points, in two different processes.**
- **Two processes share at most one channel.**
- The previous two properties guarantee, that **deadlocks are not possible.**
- **No disconnected, unreachable processes.** If we imagine a graph with processes as nodes, and channels
  as edges, it will always be a single connected tree.

Despite the language being dynamically typed at the moment, the above properties hold. With the exception of
_no unreachable processes_, they also hold statically. **A type system with linear types is on the horizon,**
but I want to fully figure out the semantics first.

Some features important for a real-world language are still missing:

- Primitive types, like **strings and numbers.** However, Par is expressive enough to enable custom
  representations of numbers, booleans, lists, streams, and so on. Just like Î»-calculus, but with channels
  and expressive concurrency.
- **Replicable values.** But, once again, replication can be implemented manually, for now.
- **Non-determinism.** This can't be implemented manually, but I alredy have a mechanism thought out.

One non-essential feature that will almost certainly make it into the language later is **reactive values.**
Those update automatically based on their dependencies changing.
