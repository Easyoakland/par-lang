## Setting up

If you don't have Rust and Cargo installed, [do that first](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Then clone this repository and execute

```
$ cargo run
```

to open the interactive playground.

# The Par language guide

Par (â…‹) is an experimental concurrent programming language. It's an attempt to bring the expressive power
of linear logic into practice.

Since this is a programming language guide and not a math textbook, we won't be mentioning logic from now on,
until the very last section. **It's not important to know anything about logic to understand the language.**
The value of basing the language on linear logic is that it provides a powerful design guidance.

First off, let's list some **general properties of Par:**

- Code executes in **isolated processes.**
- Processes **communicate** with each other **via channels.**
- Every channel has **two end-points, in two different processes.**
- **Two processes share at most one channel.**
- The previous two properties guarantee, that **deadlocks are not possible.**
- **No disconnected, unreachable processes.** If we imagine a graph with processes as nodes, and channels
  as edges, it will always be a single connected tree.

Despite the language being dynamically typed at the moment, the above properties hold. With the exception of
_no unreachable processes_, they also hold statically. **A type system with linear types is on the horizon,**
but I want to fully figure out the semantics first.

**All values in Par are channels.** Processes are intangible, they only exist by
executing, and operating on tangible objects: channels. How can it possibly all be channels?

- **A list?** That's a channel sending all its items in order, then signaling the end.
- **A function?** A channel that receives the function argument, then becomes the result.
- **An infinite stream?** Also a channel! This one will be waiting to receive a signal to either
  produce the next item, or to close.

Some features important for a real-world language are still **missing:**

- Primitive types, like **strings and numbers.** However, Par is expressive enough to enable custom
  representations of numbers, booleans, lists, streams, and so on. Just like Î»-calculus, but with channels
  and expressive concurrency.
- **Replicable values.** But, once again, replication can be implemented manually, for now.
- **Non-determinism.** This can't be implemented manually, but I alredy have a mechanism thought out.

One non-essential feature that I really hope will make it into the language later is **reactive values.**
It's those that update automatically based on their dependencies changing.

## Getting started

To get familiar with the interactive playground after opening it, type this code into the editor on the left:

```
define rgb = [value] value {
  red?   => .red!
  green? => .green!
  blue?  => .blue!
}

define stream_of_rgbs = [input] begin {
  close => do {
    input?
  } in !

  next => do {
    input[value]
    let color = rgb(value)
  } in (color) loop
}
```

Don't worry about understanding this code just yet.

Press `Compile` to make the code runnable. Par compiles a high-level language with ergonomic syntactic constructs
into a lower-level process language (which is very close to a subset of the high-level language). If you're interested
in what the compiled code looks like, press `âœ… Show compiled`.

Now, press `Run` to open a list of compiled definitions; any one can be run and interacted with.

Running `rgb` prompts a choice of three colors.

After choosing the desired color, it's copied from right to left.

Running `stream_of_rgbs` prompts a choice of `close` or `next`. Every `next` triggers a prompt of a new color.
Notice that you're allowed to request new prompts before the previous ones are resolved. This is a small show
of Par's concurrency in action.
